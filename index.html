  <!-- Short Descripition of myself -->
  <p>
    My Name is Ze Hao He, I was Born in Hong Kong, China. Moved to the U.S. at
    the age of 12. I am currently working for a mortgage tech company, where we
    develop software and provide techincal services for banks and mortgage
    lenders. As myself, I main write the process of how a loan process should be
    handle, having knowledge of how a mortgage operate is a must for the job.
    Recently, I have been promoted to a software test enginner, not only I need
    to understand the code, the calculation within the codes need to be an exact
    number once it is done. My strongest suit in programming is Java, where I
    mainly write algorithm to calculate percentage and amount with different
    inputs base on income, dependents and asset. I am planning working in a
    Cyber Security sector in the future. to know more about me check out my

    <a href="./He_portfolio_website/my_fun_facts.html">fun facts page</a>.
